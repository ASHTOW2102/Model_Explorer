**Model Explorer**
**Overview**
Model Explorer is a web application that showcases various AI models deployed by organizations and developers. It provides users with a platform to browse, explore, and compare different models, along with detailed information about each model's description, use cases, and more.
**JavaScript Framework**
Model Explorer is built using React framework. No major plugins or packages were installed, as the application was kept lightweight and focused on core functionalities.
**Page Load Time**
The page load time of the application was measured using browser developer tools. By analyzing the network activity and resource loading times, an average page load time of X seconds was observed.
**Optimizations**
To decrease the load time and improve performance, the following optimizations were implemented:
•	Utilized lazy loading and code splitting to load components asynchronously, reducing initial bundle size and improving load times.
•	Implemented server-side rendering (SSR) for faster initial page rendering and improved SEO.
•	Minimized the usage of external dependencies and kept the codebase clean to reduce overhead and improve performance.
•	Implemented caching mechanisms for API requests and static assets to reduce server load and improve response times.
